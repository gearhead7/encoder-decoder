CRYPTOGRAPHY  MACHINE

CRYPTOGRAPHY - Cryptography is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text or cipher text and vice-versa. It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. Cryptography not only protects data from theft or alteration, but can also be used for user authentication.

CIPHER TEXT -  It is the result of encoding a plain text. With the help of cryptography we can convert a plain text to a cipher text which can not be read normally. We have to decode the cipher text to make a plain text.

Example - 

PLAIN TEXT- Hey there, this is my first project and this is a plain text.

CIPHER TEXT OR ENCODED TEXT - Gdxzsgdqd.zsghrzhrzlxzehqrszoqnidbsz,mczsghrzhrz,zok,hmzsdws?

Enter the plain text in the “Enter your secret message:” option.

Then choose the E mode to encrypt the plain text.

Now by choosing the E option the plain text will encrypted into a cipher text.

The result will look like this:

You can also decode this cipher text and can turn it into a plain text.

Simply put your cipher text in the “Enter your secret message:” option

Then choose the decode option by choosing the D option.

Then after choosing the decode option the cipher text will convert into a normal text.

The result will look like this,

The whole process of Encoding look like this:

The decoding process will look like this:

THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN PYTHON.
